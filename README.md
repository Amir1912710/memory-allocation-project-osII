This simulator code write in c++
This simulator uses to allocate the processes in the blocks according to the size of blocks with 3 algorithms you choose:
1- First fit
2- Best fit
3- Worst fit

At first the simulator ask you to choose the algorithm you want to use, then ask you to enter the number of blocks and the size of each block,
then ask you to enter the number of processes and the size of each process.
